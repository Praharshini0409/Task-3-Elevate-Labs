CREATE TABLE: Defines a new table in the database with specified columns and their data types.

INSERT INTO: Adds rows of data to an existing table.

SELECT: Retrieves data from one or more tables, allowing for various filtering and aggregation.

WHERE: Filters records based on a specified condition.

ORDER BY: Sorts the result set by one or more columns in either ascending or descending order.

GROUP BY: Groups rows that have the same values into summary rows, often used with aggregate functions like COUNT, SUM, etc.

INNER JOIN: Combines rows from two or more tables, where there is a match in both tables.

LEFT JOIN: Returns all rows from the left table and matching rows from the right table; if no match, returns NULL for the right table’s columns.

RIGHT JOIN: Returns all rows from the right table and matching rows from the left table; if no match, returns NULL for the left table’s columns.

Subquery: A query embedded within another query, often used to return values for comparison or further filtering.

Aggregate Functions (SUM, AVG): Perform calculations on a set of values to return a single result. SUM adds values, AVG calculates the average.

CREATE VIEW: Creates a virtual table (view) based on the result of a query, which can be used in subsequent queries as if it were a table.

CREATE INDEX: Creates an index on one or more columns of a table to improve query performance by speeding up data retrieval.
